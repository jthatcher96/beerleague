# Beer League
A basic Ruby on Rails CRUD app for tracking intramural sports league statistics built over 3 days.



## Functionality
Beer League is an exercise in RESTful routing, Ruby on Rails, and agile workflow. Our team was asked to build web application that could keep track of our "client's" recreational sports league. 

The finished product allows users to sign in as players, managers, or league admins. As a player you may only view your games and scores. Team managers may edit their rosters, and must record the scores of their games. The league manager may create new seasons, new teams, and all other administrative duties. Simple, efficient, and effective.
